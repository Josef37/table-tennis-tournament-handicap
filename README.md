# Table Tennis Tournament Handicap

Making club tournaments fair again!

## About

When playing club tournaments in table tennis, we often find players of wildly different skill competing against another.

This results in the better player not trying and the worse player not seeing any chance of winning - making the game boring for both.

We can fix this by giving the worse player a few points advantage. But how much?

From the difference in ranking points we get an expected win probability for each game.
From that value we can deduce a win probability for each point.
Now we can try different different point advantages and calculate the win probability for these modified games.

## How to use

```bash
npm install --global yarn
yarn install
yarn start
# Look for ./output/result.csv
```

There are some configuration options in `src/index.ts::config`.

## Calculations

There are a few underlying assumptions:

1. The win expectation from ranking points is correct - also for larger differences in ranking points.
2. We can deduce the win probability of a single point from the win probability of the whole game.
   In reality some players improve during the game (and often lose the first set).
   In our model we have a constant probability $p$ for winning each point. The probability of winning the whole game is merely a function $q=f(p)$.

Let $p$ be the probability of winning a point,
$r$ be the probability of winning a set and
$q$ be the probability of winning a game/match.

$$
\begin{align*}
q(r) &= P(3:0) + P(3:1) + P(3:2) \\
&= r^3 + \binom{3}{1} r^3 (1-r) + \binom{4}{2} r^3 (1-r)^2 \\
&= r^3(10 - 15r - 6r^2) \\
\end{align*}
$$

$$
\begin{align*}
r(p) &= \sum_{i=0}^9 P(11:i) + \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} P(i+12:i+10) \\
&= \sum_{i=0}^9 \binom{10+i}{i} p^{11} (1-p)^i + \binom{20}{10} p^{12} (1-p)^{10} \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} (2p(1-p))^i \\
&= p^{11} \left( \sum_{i=0}^9 \binom{10+i}{i} (1-p)^i + \binom{20}{10} p (1-p)^{10} \frac{1}{1-2p+2p^2} \right) \\
\end{align*}
$$

When providing an advantage $s$ the formula changes like following.

$$
r(p,s) = p^{11-s} \left( \sum_{i=0}^9 \binom{10-s+i}{i} (1-p)^i + \binom{20-s}{10} p (1-p)^{10} \frac{1}{1-2p+2p^2} \right)
$$

With that we can write $q$ as a function of $p$.

The win expectation from the ranking points $t$ is defined like this:

$$
q(t) = \frac{1}{1+10^{\frac{t}{150}}}
$$

We set $q(t) = q(p)$ and solve for $p$ numerically.
_Note: Since we're using a non-scientific programming language, we have to program the solver ourselves, so we chose to use the [bisection method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisection_method)._
